# Changelog

All notable changes to Orchard are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.12.4] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- Sidebar badges showing counts at a glance: running containers, and the number of images, mounts, DNS domains, and networks.
- Diagnostic logging via Apple's unified logging system — filter by subsystem `dev.andon.orchard` in Console.app when troubleshooting.
- Continuous integration: the unit test suite runs on every pull request and must pass before a release can ship.

### Fixed
- Failed actions no longer fail silently. Many operations that failed wrote an error message that most views never displayed, so buttons could appear to do nothing ([#54](https://github.com/andrew-waters/orchard/issues/54)). Errors now appear in a standard alert.
- Fixed potential crashes when adding or editing a container's port mappings, volume mounts, or environment variables, and when validating a container name.
- Builder status and container stats failures are no longer silently ignored.
- CLI commands (builder, DNS, kernel, and system-property operations, including the admin-password prompt for DNS changes) now run off the main thread, so the UI no longer freezes while they execute.

## [1.12.3] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- Automatic in-app updates via [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org). Orchard now checks for updates in the background (after asking on first launch) and can install them in place; "Check for Updates…" is also available from the menu. Updates are delivered through an EdDSA-signed appcast.

### Changed
- The previous manual "check GitHub releases for a newer version" prompt has been replaced by Sparkle.

## [1.12.2] - 2026-06-16
